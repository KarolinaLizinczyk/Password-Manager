## Design Notes
* I decided to develop this application with Flask framework, because it is simple and documentation as well as developer tools are excellent
* To build this application I used Flask instead of pure Python, because it helped me implement backend logic very fast.
* Django together with Flask are two the most popular frameworks, however in contrast to Django, Flask gives me the opportunity to choose modules and lets me decide how to interact with them.
* I decided to use PostgreSQL as it is production type of database and is popular in Python communities
* I decided to use Bootstrap for this project as it is simple, has extensive list of components as well as base styling for most of Html elements
* Folders and files were grouped based on app based structure, which means things are grouped by application. This pattern is used by default in Django.
* The application was built with accordance to the best practices for Python and follows PEP8, when sensible.
